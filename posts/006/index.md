In Canada and at least as a foreing student, health insurance is part of the tuition bill required each semester. At the University of Montreal, they cost 300$CA per semester (more details [here](http://www.bei.umontreal.ca/bei/ass_couverture.htm)). There is also an additional plan specific to dental insurance. By default, students are signed up for these two plans and the fees are included in the tuition. However, it is possible to waive them if a student already has another insurance. A little warning here: saving on health insurance plans is cool on the paper, but you should make sure you do have a working alternative heatlh insurance before you cancel the one offered by the university. Medical fees in Canada can add up very quickly!

French citizens covered by the French Health Insurance ([Assurance Maladie](https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure)) can beneficiate from an agreement between Québec and France in order to sign up for free for the [RAMQ](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr), the Québec Health Insurance (*Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec*). This is not an automatic process: it is not because you are French that you can immediately revoke the Health Insurance fees from the university. You must first sign up for the RAMQ, then, proving a proof of affiliation to the RAMQ, you can ask for the fees to be removed. There are deadlines to do so and the process is slow because both the RAMQ and the Assurance Maladie are public services. During your very first semester in Canada, it can be hard to finish the process in time to avoid having to pay for the University's default health plan.

Overall, the main steps are the following: one must get a form signed by the Health Insurance in France, then send it to the RAMQ along with a few other papers, and then, once they receive (by post mail!) the confirmation that the RAMQ accepted the application, they must submit such proof to the University in order to waive the health insurance fees. It takes a few days to receive the confirmation that your health plan is valid and for the fees to be removed from the bill.  

Health insurance wise, several deadlines were applicable. For Winter 2022, mine were that:

- by the 14th of February, I had to have fully paid my tuition;
- which meant I had until the 13th of February to remove the fees from my bill;
- if not, I had to pay the full bill, and then I had until the 15th of March to finish the paperwork and request a refund.

First things first, I may have mentioned it already, but there is a series of fees that are automatically added to a student's bill even if they are not mandatory. At the University of Montreal, they are called the "CANO" (*cotisations automatiques non obligatoires*). There is ([here](https://ombudsman.umontreal.ca/foire-aux-questions/faq/news/detail/News/comment-me-desister-des-assurances-ou-dautres-frais-non-obligatoires/)) a rather complete documentation on which fees belong to this category, how much money they represent, what they pay for and the various process to waive them. The docmentation also includes fees related to health insurance. Before the February deadline, I got most of these CANO fees taken off my bills, as well as the fees relating to the dental insurance.  

Now I was left with 600$CA for the main health insurance.  

I found it difficult to find information about the agreement between Frace and Québec on the Assurance Maladie's website, because they dedicate only one small portion of text to ["insurance and studies abroad"](https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/droits-demarches/europe-international/protection-sociale-etranger/etudes-etranger), mixing studies inside Europe and outside of Europe, which are very different.  

For studies in Québec, it is said that:

- students traveling to Québec within the frame of a university exchange should use the form [**SE Q-401-106**](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/media/2516);
- and that students enrolled in the Québec university should instead use the form **SE Q-401-102**.

They say nothing about which situation applies to a PhD student in cotutelle: is it considered a university exchange since you are enrolled in a French university or is it considered to be an enrolling in a Québec university? For most of my paperwork with Canada, aside from the *convention de cotutelle*, my paperwork was essentially the same as someone enrolling only to a Canadian university. Additionally, SE 401-Q-106 required the French university to sign the form, whereas SE 401-Q-102 only required a signature from the Assurance Maladie. SE 401-Q-102 seemed applicable and faster, so I opted for it.  

Let's say it right away: it was a mistake. I should have opted for SE 401-Q-106 from the beginning.  

Whatever situations you are in, you cannot simultaneously be enrolled in the French Assurance Maladie and the RAMQ. The main difference between the two forms is actually that:

- SE 401-Q-102 will have you struck off from the Assurance Maladie (and asked to destroy your Carte Vitale) until you come back to France and go through the process (and paperwork) to be reintegrated into the system,
- whereas SE 401-Q-106 will have your rights temporarily deactivated: SE 401-Q-106 ask you to provide the precise dates of your stay in Québec. Upon your return, your rights are simply (and normally automatically) reactivated.  

To make it short, both form work for a cotutelle. But if you are going to Canada for only one semestre, you should go for the SE 401-Q-106!

I realized my mistake after arriving to Québec and talking with other French people having recently moved to Montreal. I was still waiting for the Assurance Maladie to return the signed SE 401-Q-102 form, so I decided to start over and sent the SE 401-Q-106 form to my university. They signed returned it within one day. I sent it to the Assurance Maladie explaining my mistake and asked to start over. Because of this error, I wasn't able to waive the 600$CA from my bill before the February deadline. I had to pay the tuition along with the 600$CA and focused on finishing the paperwork on time to be able to ask for a refund.  

Luckily, it played out pretty well and I now have a 600$CA credit line with the University of Montreal, waiting to be deduced from my next tuition in September.  

Now, the unfortunate news for me is that due to the fact that I will be traveling to Canada every over trimester... I'll have to do this process each time. It is only applicable one trip at a time.  

Before closing this rather long post, I want to mention another mistake I made. Form 102 and 106 are impossible to find on the Assurance Maladie's website. I found both form via a Google search, but it is said that you can request the form to the Assurance Maladie's services. Unfortunately, the SE 401-Q-106 that I found was an old version: I only found out when I submitted it to the RAMQ. They refused it, even though the Assurance Maladie had signed it, and I had to go through the whole signature process one more time. Speak of unnecessary paperwork... I strongly recommend using the forms provided on the RAMQ website: they are common to both the French and the Québec administration and actually findable on the RAMQ's website.  
 
A final warning: upon talking with some of my fellow French students at the University of Montréal, I realized that my university has been particularly flexible (has they should have been) regarding signing the form. They were not only quick at doing it: other universities may ask you to first finish setting the *convention de cotutelle* before they will accept to sign the SE 401-Q-106 form. This is particularly unfaire because, as I mentioned in post 004 setting this document can take a year. For example, as of today, I still don't have this document, it is still in progress.
