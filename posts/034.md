The Biological Station of the Laurentides (or *Station Biologique des Laurentides*) is a quite unique place where it is possible to come and spend a few days (or a few weeks, so I've heard) to work on your research. At the end of October, I joined a 3-day long "writing retreat" organized by my Department at the University of Montr√©al. It was my first time at the SBL but hopefully not my last, although the Station closes during Winter.
