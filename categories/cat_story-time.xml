The goal of this project was to explore new ways to index the content of thousands of thousands of notary registries which, put together, form &lt;a href="https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/siv/cms/content/fonds.action?uuid=12b&amp;amp;template=pog/pogLevel2&amp;amp;preview=false"&gt;one of the most used collections&lt;/a&gt; of the National Archives. I joined the project at the end of 2019, during its second phase, almost at the same time as &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium"&gt;eScriptorium&lt;/a&gt; was initiated. LECTAUREP had worked with &lt;a href="https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/?sc=Transkribus"&gt;Transkribus&lt;/a&gt; during the first phase (in 2018) but, given the connections between &lt;a href="http://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html"&gt;my research team&lt;/a&gt; and the team behind eScriptorium, we quickly switched to the newer software and contributed to its development.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my most important contribution is the redaction of &lt;a href="https://lectaurep.hypotheses.org/documentation/prendre-en-main-escriptorium"&gt;a tutorial for the software&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially only intended as an internal resource for our team of annotators. This is the reason why the tutorial was published on LECTAUREP's blog. &lt;a href="https://openiti.org/"&gt;OpenITI&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mar_Musa"&gt;Jonathan Allen&lt;/a&gt; rapidly offered &lt;a href="https://lectaurep.hypotheses.org/documentation/escriptorium-tutorial-en"&gt;an English translation&lt;/a&gt; which, eventually, was also published on LECTAUREP's blog. Since the publication of this translation, it is listed on eScriptorium's home page as its official tutorial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the tutorial hasn't been updated in a long time whereas major updates and new features have been added on eScriptorium's side.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LECTAUREP's blog is not a good solution. It is built with &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and hosted by &lt;a href="https://hypotheses.org/"&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; which is very convenient to allow a small, well defined, group of people to collaboratively work on a research blog, but it's too heavy and not adapted to publish the documentation of a software like eScriptorium. The documentation needs to be updated frequently to keep up with the software and, in general, a blog is not a place to publish the extensive documentation of a software. To top it all, it is not even that easy to update for me, so can you imagine someone outside of LECTAUREP trying to offer an update?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of finding a better solution since at least 2020, but it was never so urgent that I was able to put it at the top of my to-do lists. Last Summer, I took the advantage of a rather slow couple of weeks in August, when every one but me seemed to have gone on vacations, to put something different in place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Readthedocs&lt;/a&gt; quickly appeared to me as an ideal solution: the platform is designed for publishing software documentations, it handles software versions and multi-lingual contents. Last but not least, it uses static website generators. This is fundamental because it allows for the publication of the source code on a platforms like &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and will actually use this public source code to build the website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github is a platform designed for sharing and opening codes to external contributors. Relying on it solves a major issue with the current tutorial: if anyone can suggest the correction, edition or translation of eScriptorium's documentation, then it is more likely to keep up with the evolutions of the application!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, I created a new Github repository called &lt;a href="https://github.com/alix-tz/escriptorium-documentation"&gt;escriptorium-documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/#getting-started"&gt;set a basic configuration and connected it to Readthedocs&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as this was done, the website became available at &lt;a href="https://escriptorium.readthedocs.io/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; with a URL based on the following structure: &lt;code&gt;{gh_repo_name}.readthedocs.io&lt;/code&gt;. Then, I started rewriting the content of the tutorial... following &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html"&gt;Sphinx' syntax&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so painful that I never got back to it after I came back from my own vacations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why painful? Well, I had discovered Markdown in 2017 and I have used it since. It's so powerful and yet so light! In comparison, Sphinx felt like such a complicated and heavy syntax. Not as heavy as HTML, but less intuitive nonetheless. I had to go through the documentation every time I wanted to add something as simple as a hyperlink or an image!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, when I gathered enough motivation&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to go back to working on eScriptorium's tutorial, I decided to look for an alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/builders/index.html#sphinx.builders.html.DirectoryHTMLBuilder"&gt;Sphinx compilers&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only non-sphinx-based option available with readthedocs is &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html"&gt;Mkdocs&lt;/a&gt;. Like its name hints at, &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;Mkdocs&lt;/a&gt; is a Markdown compiler, capable to quickly build websites. The set-up is really quick, it's well documented, fairly easy to customize and it's possible to add a lot of &lt;a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown-extensions/#emoji"&gt;cool extensions which are based on Python&lt;/a&gt;. It was the bomb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked Mkdocs so much that I also used it to rebuild &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/"&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, I have spent a lot of time working on this new tutorial for eScriptorium. I designed a basic structure, breaking down the features into different categories. Now the pages are progressively being filled and I am very happy to have been joined in my efforts by my colleagues Hugo Scheithauer and Floriane Chiffoleau. As we progressively merge the content of new pages to the main branch, the &lt;a href="https://escriptorium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;escriptorium-tutorial&lt;/a&gt; website expands. It will be ready soon for an official release!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope that the transparency and simplicity brought by Mkdocs and Markdown will allow many people to add their contributions to the documentation of eScriptorium! Who knows, maybe you will too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: we changed the name of the repository to escriptorium-documentation instead of escriptorium-tutorial (all links and mentions were changed in this post). The decision was motivated by the fact the "tutorial" felt like an inexact description of the actual scope/ambition of the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also when I got more free time after &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/009/"&gt;my classes were over&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to use readthedocs to deploy a website built with Mkdocs. In the case of the tutorial, it simply allows us to have a domain name more meaningful than ".github.io". &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I didn't mean to post again about Health Insurance in Canada, but I can't resist telling this story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building from my experience (and mistakes) during Winter 2022, I thought that the process would be a piece of cake from then on. Uh-uh, not so fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At least, I started right from the beginning with the correct form!"&lt;sup id="fnref:right"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:right"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True. However, I got too confident in the speed of the process and forgot to take into account the French Summer vacations. I didn't send the signature request to my university before the 1st of August (a little over a month before my departure). The people in charge of signing were already on vacation. While this step had been very quick in Winter, this time it took almost a month: I only got the form with its signature back on the 30th of August, less than a week before my departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately printed the document and rushed to the Post office to send it to the &lt;a href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure"&gt;Assurance Maladie&lt;/a&gt;. I still had one month and two weeks to finish the full process in order to remove some 300$CA fees from the bill at the University of Montréal. It seemed feasible. In December, my initial envoy to the Assurance Maladie had seemingly never made it to the Assurance Maladie, so this time I decided to play it safe: I printed the document myself&lt;sup id="fnref:posting_online"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:posting_online"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and sent it as a registered letter, with a tracking number and a return receipt request.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How glad (and despairing) was I! Thanks to this tracking number, I was able to see that my letter... never left that Post office. After a week and a half, I sent a claim to La Poste, but since I couldn't wait for them to lead an investigation&lt;sup id="fnref:investigation_outcome"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:investigation_outcome"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my partner had to print the form a second time and send it again (I was already in Canada at that time).&lt;sup id="fnref:second_failure"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:second_failure"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! The letter finally made it to the Assurance Maladie. But the time frame was narrowing down quickly! I had to contact the Assurance Maladie via the mobile app to try to politely urge then to send it back to me quickly. Eventually, I received it duly signed on September 27. I had two weeks left to send it to the &lt;a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr"&gt;RAMQ&lt;/a&gt; and get an acceptation letter to be able to reduce my bill.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasting no time, I praised the RAMQ for allowing me to &lt;a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/citoyens/assurance-medicaments/inscrire-desinscrire/r2"&gt;upload the file(s) on their website&lt;/a&gt;, but cursed them when I received a confirmation notice telling me that they would take up to 60 days to process it. 60 days! I only had 17 left!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, as far as my bill was concerned, I had two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay the 300$CA and hope for the process to be over by the 15th of November (to have it refunded to me as a credit from UdeM on my next tuition&lt;sup id="fnref:credit"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:credit"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or refuse to pay that part of the bill and begin having a debt of 300$CA towards the University, potentially pay interests on it and hope for the process to be over by the 15th of November (to have it retroacctively removed from the bill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semester, I was only finally getting my 600$CA from Winter, because in February I had chosen the first and safest option. This time, I took a gamble and went for the second scenario. I wasn't sure of the actual consequences of contracting a debt with the University, but I was holding on the hope that the RAMQ wouldn't take as long as they announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October seemed to go by really slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sign of life from the RAMQ reached me on the 26th of October. Unfortunately, in a letter dated from the 14th, they listed all the items they expected to find in the form and rejected my request until I sent a complete form ASAP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait, what? My form, not complete?!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it possible I used the wrong form again? No, it wasn't that... Did I forget to check a box somewhere? No... Did the Assurance Maladie not correctly fill their part? No, still not that. What was wrong then? The only way to find out at that point was to call the RAMQ. I did so the following day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll skip the hour-long wait on the phone with (or without) music and, boom! Here is the answer: somehow, they only received the last page of the PDF I uploaded on their website. But twice. Twice the last page. The first page, nowhere to be seen!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refused to let a bug cost me 300$CA, so I begged the operator to let me have a way to send the missing page faster than the Post Office, and safer than their glitching upload platform. This is how I found myself (with my visiting partner) at the nearest Uniprix, playing with their public printer and sending my form... by fax!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiting resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how long it would take. Did that fax even reach the operator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready to give up on my 300$CA. I was losing hope that I would ever get an answer on time. I was cursing the University of Montréal for making it so stupidly complicated to remove an illegitimate amount from my bill, cursing the RAMQ and the Assurance Maladie for being so slow and not having automatized such a process with a shared plateform, cursing La Poste for being unreliable and losing my letters, cursing myself for not starting the process sooner, had I known! Raaaah!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on November 4, suddenly, unexpectedly, there it was. My Canadian Grail. The letter of acceptation into the RAMQ.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With trembling hands, unable to erase a smile from my face, blinking once or twice, I captured it with my phone, and connected to the Task Manager on the University of Montréal website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press "Confirm"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, a few days later poof! gone, my 300$CA debt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only remained, the 2,56$CA of interests generated during these three weeks, on a debt that should have never existed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I surrender, I won't fight any longer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll pay this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:right"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aka, I didn't use SE-401-Q-104, nor used the outdated version of SE-401-Q-106. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:right" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:posting_online"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Poste offers a service consisting in allowinf you to upoload a PDF which they will print and send for you. I used in December due to the difficulty to find a open Post office during the Christmas period. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:posting_online" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:investigation_outcome"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation took less than 2 weeks if I remember correctly. But I was right to make another envoy in parallel because they never found the letter and eventually sent me a refund. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:investigation_outcome" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:second_failure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! It is the second time La Poste loses my SE-401-Q-106... How unlucky is that? &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:second_failure" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:credit"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explained in my the post n°006, this amount is not directly refunded to you. It only appears as a debt to you from the University and will only be deducted from your next bill. It's unconvenient for two reasons: 1) it's a credit you end up giving the University and given the amount, you could really use that money for something else (like buying food for a month or paying rent), 2) when you don't pay tuition every semester (as is my case), you have to wait a really long time for that money to make it back to you! &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:credit" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
