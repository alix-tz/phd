And I found out while I was working on a completely different dataset. Let me explain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I helped my colleague train a Kraken transcription model for &lt;a href="https://ecrituresnumeriques.ca/fr/Activites/Projets/2016/1/19/Anthologie-grecque"&gt;Greek manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;. They gave me the ground truth and I set and executed the training from the command line. It gave me an opportunity to try fine-tuning a model like &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7234166"&gt;CREMMA Medieval&lt;/a&gt;, in stead of only training from scratch. &lt;strong&gt;CREMMA Medieval&lt;/strong&gt; was trained on manuscripts written in Latin, whereas the Greek manuscripts were written only, well, in Ancient Greek. I didn't want the resulting model to add Latin letters in the transcription when applied to other Greek documents, so I used Kraken's option to allow the model to forget previously learned characters and to force it to only remember the characters contained in the new training data. This option is called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;--resize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (check the documentation &lt;a href="https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken/blob/4.3.7/docs/ketos.rst#fine-tuning"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I fine-tune a model, I usually follow Kraken's recommendations and keep both the previously learned characters and the new ones coming from the new set of ground truth. When this morning I checked what is the keyword to use to keep only the characters from the new dataset, I realized that I didn't correctly set the training on Peraire last week. I had set it to only keep the new characters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until Kraken v. 4.3.10, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;--resize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can take the keywords &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;both&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The ambiguity of these keywords &lt;a href="https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken/issues/478"&gt;has been discussed&lt;/a&gt; in the past, which is the reason why starting from Kraken v. 4.3.10, the keywords respectively become &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's quote the manual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two modes dealing with mismatching alphabets, &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; resizes the output layer and codec of the loaded model to include all characters in the new training set without removing any characters. &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; will make the resulting model an exact match with the new training set by both removing unused characters from the model and adding new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell for this trap of ambiguity and used &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; meant I was keep &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; character sets. (Again this is the very reason why the keywords were recently changed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note: you should really read &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/"&gt;last week's post&lt;/a&gt; to fully understand the rest of this post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my post last week, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_D&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand seems to lose it completely on the B series. This is most likely due to the fact that the contrast between the page and the "ink" is too low in the pencil-written series compared to the data used to train &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt; and in the D series. &lt;strong&gt;peraire_D&lt;/strong&gt; even loses 11 points of accuracy to &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could I be sure that it was not actually due to the fact that the model had unlearned some precious characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to know, I thought, was to re-train the models! I used this opportunity to also train the models from scratch because I was curious to see how much noise/improvement was brought by the base model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried 4 types of models and, like last week, used &lt;a href="https://github.com/WHaverals/CERberus"&gt;CERberus üê∂üê∂üê∂&lt;/a&gt; to measure the character error rates on the predictions made on the test sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models trained "from scratch"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A model not trained on any data coming from the Peraire dataset (aka &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6657809"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models obtained from finetuning &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt; using the &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; resize mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models obtained from finetuning &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt; using the &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; resize mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each model trained on the Peraire dataset, I used 3 compositions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the full dataset ("ALL")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only data coming from the B series ("B")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only data coming from the D series ("D")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the same composition system for the test sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my results in the form of a table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/peraire_scores.png" alt="a table of the scored obtained on the different train set, test set and resize configurations" widht="400px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it seems that my previous interpretation is not fully contradicted by the results I obtain with this second series of training. Let's focus on two observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a model is trained only on the D series, and tested only on the B series, it appears to be completely incapable of predicting anything but gibberish, losing between 32 and 35 points of accuracy. It confirms that the aspect of the documents from the two series are too different. On the other hand, when the model is fine-tuned on the B series only, it maintains a fairly good accuracy when applied to the D series, whichever resize mode is used. I think it confirms that the B series is enough for the model to learn some sort of formal features from Peraire's handwriting, which the models can transfer to documents written with a different writing instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is very interesting is the difference between the models trained on the whole datasets and tested on the B series: when we use the &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; resize mode (meaning we only keep the characters from the new dataset), the model is very good. On the contrary, the performance of the model trained with the &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; resize mode (meaning we keep the output layer and the codec from the base model and add the new characters) is as bad as with a model trained only on the D series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_both&lt;/strong&gt; is able to generalize from seeing both datasets and even benefits from seeing more data thanks to the D series, since it performs better on the B series compared to &lt;strong&gt;peraire_B&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the light of my experiment with the &lt;strong&gt;resize&lt;/strong&gt; option, I think this is not correct. Instead, it appears that resetting the output layer by using &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;) on accident, allowed the model to better take into account the data from the B series (pencil). Contrary to what I observed last week, the model trained on the whole dataset but this time with the &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; resize mode (or &lt;strong&gt;union&lt;/strong&gt;) doesn't benefit from seeing more data compared to the model trained only on the B series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that keeping the output layer from the base model with &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;union&lt;/strong&gt;) probably drowns the specificity of the pencil-written documents into a base knowledge tailored to handle documents with a high contrast (like the ones in the D series &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;'s training set). Or, to put it differently, when we use &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;), more attention is given to the pencil written documents, meaning that the model actually gets better at handling this category of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am extremely curious to see how I can investigate this further, or if any of you, readers, would understand these results differently!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>experiment</category><category>HTR</category><category>kraken</category><guid>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/014/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 17:51:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>013 - The Peraire experiment</title><link>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/</link><dc:creator>Alix Chagu√©</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WARNING: in my &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/014/"&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, I nuance the conclusions drawn in this post, because of a parameter I didn't correctly set during the training of the models described below. You should really read it after reading this post, to get the full picture!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a small side project during my phD, I have been sharing my expertise (and a bit of my workforce) with the members of the &lt;a href="https://www.pamir.fr/projets-soutenus/spe-vlp/"&gt;DIM SPE-VLP&lt;/a&gt; project. The acronym stands for "Sauver le patrimoine esp√©rantiste : le voyage de Lucien P√©raire (1928-1932)." The project revolves around the digitization, transcription and edition/valorization of &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_P%C3%A9raire"&gt;Lucien Peraire&lt;/a&gt;'s archives. He was a French citizen who, in the late 1920s, travelled across the European and the Asian continents, mostly by bike and using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; to communicate. He kept a diary during his journey (and later published a book about his adventures). His notes are written both in French and in Esperanto and in some documents, he also used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand"&gt;stenography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My contribution to the project has mostly consisted in helping developing transcription models for the French diaries (although I'm also interested in the shorthand and the esperanto). This meant both helping with the production of ground truth and training &lt;a href="https://kraken.re/"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; models. This post will briefly explain how the ground truth was created and published, as well as present the models that were trained with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peraire's notebooks are organized in different series, and each series is divided in ensembles regrouping the pages of a notebook. Each ensemble is named after the countries visited while the notebook was used. For example, notebook 11 in the B series forms one ensemble and covers a part of Peraire's travels in Japan. There are 31 notebooks in the B series. The notebooks of this series are written with a blue pencil on (low quality) school papers. On some pages, the pencil is very faded which makes it hard to read the text, let alone to run a successful segmentation task on the image. On the other hand, the D series gathers notes and comments on the diaries, written at the end of the 1960s. This time the handwriting is much easier to read because Peraire mostly used a blue or black ball-point pen. There are 9 ensembles in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/peraire_handwriting.png" alt="two extracts of Peraire's notebooks side by side, on the left the image is taken from the B series, on the right the image is taken from the D series." widht="600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that I find particularly interesting with this dataset is that we have a case where the handwriting is similar but the writing tool is different. It means that it is possible to explore how the writing tools and/or writing supports affect the efficiency of a transcription model. On top of that, all the documents were digitized under the same (good) conditions and by the same people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Segmenting, transcribing, aligning and publishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of the dataset was solely focused on the B series. I selected 1 random page from each ensemble (avoiding to take the first page each time) to compose a train set of 33 files&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. On top of that, I selected 4 additional pages from B3, B5, B12 and B18 to compose a fixed test set which would never be used as training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pre-segmented the images with Kraken's default model before correcting the result manually. At this point, I also applied the &lt;a href="https://segmonto.github.io/"&gt;segmOnto&lt;/a&gt; ontology for the lines and regions&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because of the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alix-tz/peraire-ground-truth/master/data/train/B.2.europe-orientale_0007.jpg"&gt;fading ink&lt;/a&gt;, some words could not be transcribed. In order to avoid complicating the transcription rules, I decided to simply segment out the passages that couldn't be read. On the one hand it simplifies the transcription, but on the other hand, it means that a small portion of my segmented documents cannot be re-used by others to train a segmentation model. Since we were not training a segmentation model, it was an easy decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/peraire_faded.png" alt="screenshot showing the segmentation and the transcription panels from eScriptorium where we can see that some lines are broken down into several segments and that some segments were left blank" widht="400px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, it was decided to augment the dataset with examples from the D series because the model trained on the B series was not good enough. This time, Gilles P√©rez, a member of the project, took charge of the transcription. I recommended to create a new sample of 30 to 40 images, so he randomly selected series of 4 continuous pages from each ensemble. The transcription of the corresponding 36 pages was sent to me as a Word document. Therefore, on top of taking care of the segmentation of the images, I also went through an alignment phase during which I verified the order of the lines and copy-pasted the transcription. It took longer than I expected but it allowed me to align the transcription with the rules I had followed when creating the first set. I also picked 4 of the 36 pages to add to the test set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset is versioned and published applying the principles and tools we developed withing the frame of &lt;a href="https://htr-united.github.io/"&gt;HTR-United&lt;/a&gt;. I also added illustrated segmentation and transcription guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing different dataset configurations to train transcription models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, the goal of these datasets was to create transcription models. Taking the opportunity of the recent update of the dataset, I tried different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never trained the model from scratch because the dataset is too small to get any sort of usable model. Instead, I used &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6657809"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a base model, fine-tuned with the Peraire dataset. (We were actually able to use Peraire as an example during the &lt;a href="https://www.conftool.pro/dh2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;form_session=76#paperID690"&gt;DH2023&lt;/a&gt; conference&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; earlier this month to show the usefulness of having this kind of base model). I tested fine-tuning only on the B series, only on the D series or on both the B and the D series. Then I used a B-series-only test set, a D-series-only test set and the full test set to see how the models performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted to try it after discovering it during DH2023, I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/WHaverals/CERberus"&gt;CERberus üê∂üê∂üê∂&lt;/a&gt; (I talked about it in my &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/012/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;) to measure the accuracy of the models on the test sets listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lterriel/kami-app"&gt;KaMI&lt;/a&gt;, CERberus takes 2 categories of text input: the reference (aka the ground truth) and the prediction (or the hypothesis made by the model). In order to get the prediction, I loaded my models on eScriptorium, as well as the images and transcription of the test set before applying each model to the documents. This way, all the transcription are predicted with the same segmentation, which comes from the ground truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;, before fine-tuning, gets a CER of 26.16% when tested on the whole test set, and a score of 27.19% on the documents from the B series, 25.29% on the D series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_both&lt;/strong&gt;, trained on the B and the D series, gets a CER of 4.63% when tested on the whole test set, but a score of 6.41% on the documents from the B series and 3.54% on the D series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_B&lt;/strong&gt;, trained only on the B series, gets a CER of 8.72% on the whole test set, but a score of 7.12% on test-B and 9.67% on test-D.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_D&lt;/strong&gt;, trained only on the D series, gets an CER of 16.38% on the whole test set, but this is because of the enormous descripancy between its score on each sub test set. It skyrockets to a CER of 38,53% on test-B while going as low as 3.65% on test-D.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this makes sense, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ManuMcFrench&lt;/strong&gt; could not be used without fine-tuning, its error rate on both documents is too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_both&lt;/strong&gt; is able to generalize from seeing both datasets and even benefits from seeing more data thanks to the D series, since it performs better on the B series compared to &lt;strong&gt;peraire_B&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_B&lt;/strong&gt; which was trained on the more difficult dataset seems to use the knowledge inherited from &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt; and to have learned some formal features from Peraire's handwriting since it is able to maintain a fairly low CER on the D series (it gains 16 points of accuracy compared to &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;peraire_D&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand seems to lose it completely on the B series. This is most likely due to the fact that the contrast between the page and the "ink" is too low in the pencil-written series compared to the data used to train &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt; and in the D series. &lt;strong&gt;peraire_D&lt;/strong&gt; even loses 11 points of accuracy to &lt;strong&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens with &lt;strong&gt;peraire_D&lt;/strong&gt; is very interesting because it confirms that it is useful to compose a train set with examples of more difficult documents instead of only showing the ones that are easy to read! Now, the nice thing is that I will soon be working on a little experiment with my colleague Hugo Scheithauer where we will be able to measure the impact of the contrast between the ink and the paper. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT #1: I added the scores obtained by Manu McFrench alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT #2: I added a disclaimer at the beginning of the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used 2 images from B2 because one of them was extremely faded and I wanted to include some of these extreme cases in the dataset, and 2 images from B30 because it consisted of shorter lines (table of contents) which I found was interesting to include.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the documents, I only used the "InterlinearLine" and "DefaultLine" for the lines, and the "MainZone" and "NumberingZone" for the regions.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/013/#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The majority of the audience was unfamiliar with the concept of handwritten text recognition (HTR) or had little experience using it. The presentation lasted only an hour, so it couldn't delve into much detail. Its main objective was to demonstrate the software's results. The presenter showed several slides, displaying on one side  images of manuscripts (often in a language unknown to the audience) and on the other side the transcriptions generated by the software. Throughout the presentation, the presenter repeatedly commented on the HTR software saying that "it did a very good job."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it even mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first aspect to explore is what distinguishes a good job from a bad one. Normally, such an evaluation relies on the measurement of the accuracy of the result compared to the ideal transcription. The accuracy can be expressed positively or negatively using the error rates (a 0% error rate is the same as a 100% accuracy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring the accuracy of a prediction (another way to call the result of HTR) is commonly done at character level. The character accuracy of a model is equal to the number of matches between the prediction and the ideal transcription. The character error rate (CER) is a very common measure to express a model's theoretical efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes softwares also consider the word error rate (WER), which is the proportion of words in the prediction containing errors. A high score at WER doesn't actually mean that the transcription is bad. It only means that the errors are distributed on all the words. I never use WER alone because it is hard to get an exact impression of the quality of the prediction based on that metric alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a paper from &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476887.3476888"&gt;Neudecker et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt; where they test 5 different software used for evaluating the prediction. They also develop an interesting reflection on alternative metrics such as the "non-stopword accuracy", the "phrase accuracy", the "flexible character accuracy" (which is useful when the line order isn't always the same), the "figure of merit" (which "aims to quantify the effort required for manual post-correction" (p. 15)) or else the "unordered WER".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your score is a rate, there is an implicit idea that 100% is both the maximum score and the targeted score (for accuracy of course). But in the case of HTR, 100% accuracy is extremely rare because there are also edge cases where the way a letter was drawn is ambiguous: in such cases the error is not particularly caused by the inaccuracy of the HTR engine but rather by the imperfection of the handwriting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.46"&gt;Hodel et al., (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, the authors provided a grid to interpret accuracy scores. They suggest the following three thresholds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CER &amp;lt; 10% == good (it allows efficient post-processing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CER &amp;lt; 5% == very good (errors are usually focused on rare or unknown words)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CER &amp;lt; 2.5% == excellent (but it is usually only reached when the handwriting is very regular)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think this grid should also include 20% and 0%. 20% as a threshold, because at 80% of accuracy, the transcription is supposedly good enough for fuzzy search and keyword spotting (I should add a reference here, but I can't find it anymore...); and 0% because it should be reminded that an accuracy of 100% is virtually impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complement this, I would like to mention another possible approach to get an interpretable score: during the DH2023 conference, Thibault Cl√©rice and I &lt;a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-04094241"&gt;presented an experiment&lt;/a&gt; where we trained a model using the same data in the train set and the test set. Our model reached an accuracy close to 90%, which we were able to use as a baseline to define the highest accuracy score possible for the data we had. Thus we were able to consider that a model approaching 90% of accuracy would be an excellent model, as far as that dataset was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still during &lt;a href="https://www.conftool.pro/dh2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&amp;amp;form_session=76#paperID395"&gt;the DH2023 conference&lt;/a&gt;, Wouter Haverals introduced &lt;a href="https://github.com/WHaverals/CERberus"&gt;CERberus üê∂üê∂üê∂&lt;/a&gt;, a web interface which addresses the same type of issues as &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lterriel/kami-app"&gt;KaMI&lt;/a&gt;: the lack of nuance in a plain CER computation. Indeed, in a CER score, every type of error has the same weight. This means that mistaking an "e" for a "√©" costs the same as mistaking a "e" for a "0": in the first case the text is likely still readable or understandable, whereas in the latter, it might not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CER metric is still very useful, but when applied to transcription projects, it is even more valuable when we can filter the types of errors we want to include in the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: I should have noted here that my reflection was focused on the evaluation of an automatic transcription in cases where you already have the expected transcription. When we apply an HTR model to a whole new set of documents, we usually don't have the correct transcription at hand (otherwise we wouldn't use HTR in the first place). This is the reason why many researchers try to find ways to evaluate the quality of the transcription without ground truth. One example can be found in &lt;a href="https://enc.hal.science/hal-03828529"&gt;Cl√©rice (2022)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to go back to our initial problem, we can see that there are many ways to draw the line between a good job and a bad one. The threshold will depend on the metric used to express the accuracy of the prediction and also (and actually mostly) on the way the generated text will be used down the line. Even though the software presentation I attended was short, I think we should always remind future users of HTR that 100% of accuracy is not always what they are seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short reflection to finish this post: I was bothered by the expression used to qualify the transcription. I am still trying to figure out a way to put it into words. On top of lacking accuracy, the expression "it did a good job" was also calling for a vision of HTR as a magic tool at the service of the searchers and students. But, in which other cases do you say that someone did "a good job?" Likely when you delegate a task to a &lt;a href="https://africanarguments.org/2023/03/the-invisible-labour-of-africa-in-the-digital-revolution/"&gt;subaltern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a problem here: in their current state, HTR engines are efficient but not to the point that people can use them without thinking clearly about what they want the engine to produce. It is easy to sell a software pretending that it is a magic servant that will do all the transcription in your place, a tool so smart that you can even consider delegating a part of your responsibility to it. But I think when new users of HTR fail to first reflect on the outcome they can reasonably expect from these engines, it creates disappointment and crappy data and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>accuracy</category><category>evaluation</category><category>HTR</category><category>metrics</category><guid>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/012/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 12:06:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>011 - Working with synthetic data</title><link>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/</link><dc:creator>Alix Chagu√©</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;What we call synthetic data are data generated artificially, as opposed to data taken from real-life samples. In the case of automatic transcription or layout analysis, it corresponds to creating fake documents or samples of text that look more or less like real ones, in stead of manually annotating existing documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main advantages of using synthetic data rather than real data is the fact that it comes already annotated. For automatic transcription for example, the annotation (transcription) is the same as the string of text passed to a text image generator. If you add to that the fact you can, in theory, generate an unlimited amount of pairs of text image and transcription, it represents an incredible opportunity to accelerate the production of training datasets. An example: &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8486162"&gt;Doush et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt; use this technique to generate PDF containing contemporary printed Arabic texts. The PDFs are printed, then re-scanned and aligned with the transcription that was used to generate the PDFs. The result is the Yarmouk dataset. As we will see later, generating fake handwritten text is a bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of this technique is that it offers an efficient way around the limitations posed by sensitive or confidential data (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11257-2_15"&gt;Hu et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;). However, let's note that confidentiality is rarely a problem when it comes to training HTR models on historical documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating fake data is not specific to computer vision (&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040720-031848"&gt;Raghunathan, 2021&lt;/a&gt;), even though it is frequently used in this case because data for computer vision tasks are costly to produce. In general, it is a fairly frequent method when machine learning techniques are involved, disregarding the field of application (&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-021-01555-8"&gt;Kataoka et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;). OCR and HTR tasks are not an exception and we can find traces of such experiments rather early (&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4669952"&gt;Beusekom et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I was exposed to the notion of synthetic data was during a informal conversation with &lt;a href="https://www.tmonnier.com/"&gt;Tom Monnier&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. At that time, he was working on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08191"&gt;docExtractor&lt;/a&gt;, a layout analysis tool that he trained with images of documents generated artificially.&lt;sup id="fnref:icfhr"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fn:icfhr"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then sometimes in 2021, while browsing through &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/launch"&gt;HuggingFace's spaces&lt;/a&gt;, I found ntt123's application that simulates &lt;a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ntt123/handwriting"&gt;handwriting&lt;/a&gt;. The application takes a text prompt as an input and generates an animation where the letters are traced on the page as if someone was writing them live. It's possible to play with two parameters: a value between 0 and 250 determining the writing style, and a weight determining the likelihood of the traced letters (the lower the weight, the higher the risk of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)"&gt;hallucinated&lt;/a&gt; letters; the higher the weight, the more standardized the tracing). It made me think back to my conversation with Tom Monnier and I wondered if it could be used to generate pairs of text and images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I dedicated a good part of my time to testing data generation tools I could find online, to see if they could be used to create a set of fake ground truth that I would use later, in other experiments. I will introduce the latter in a future post, so let's first focus on handwritten data generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I dug a bit more around ntt123's application, I was confronted with two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unfortunately, ntt123's application was developed in javascript and not documented at all which made it impossible for me to hack,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but luckily, it wasn't an original idea: instead it was one of many implementations of a proposition introduced by &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850"&gt;Alex Graves in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Graves uses online&lt;sup id="fnref:online"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fn:online"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; data from the IAM database (&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1575685"&gt;Liwicki &amp;amp; Bunke, 2005&lt;/a&gt;) and an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory"&gt;LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)&lt;/a&gt; to train a model capable of generating series of coordinates that trace letters and words. Initially, the model simply generates random series of letters and words, but it is then improved to take into account a text prompt which forces the models to generate a specific series of letters. As described before, the model also takes a weight (or bias) which normalizes the likelihood of the letters' shape, and can take a "priming line": the image of a handwritten line, whose writing style the model will try to copy. Once the coordinates are generated (including key information such as "ends-of-stroke"), it is easy to place them in an SVG file and visualize the result, with or without animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many many implementations of Alex Graves's experiment because it was such an important publication to demonstrate the usefulness of LSTM models. Several can be found on Github if you &lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=alex%20graves&amp;amp;type=repositories"&gt;search "Alex Graves"&lt;/a&gt;. For my experiment, I didn't want to develop my own adaptation of such a model, but rather to use programs that were ready to be used. This is the reason why I didn't look for papers but instead for recent (or recently updated) repositories on Github. I focused on Python programs because I wanted to be able to understand how they were developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very promising implementation of Alex Graves' proposition was Evgenii Dolotov's &lt;a href="https://github.com/X-rayLaser/pytorch-handwriting-synthesis-toolkit"&gt;pytorch-handwriting-synthesis-toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. It came with pre-trained models, and a utility scripts to feed the program a text prompt and generate an image. I &lt;a href="https://github.com/alix-tz/pytorch-handwriting-synthesis-toolkit/tree/custom"&gt;customized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:customization"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fn:customization"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the program a bit to fix a few bugs and try to make it generate several lines maintaining the same handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/PHST_fail_and_success.png" alt="4 lines stating (or supposed to state) 'did a computer write this' generated by Evgenii Dolotov's program. The fourth line is a failed attempt where several letters like y, n, m can be dinstiguished. The fifth line states 'determined to act upon the assumptions' but contains several garbled letters." widht="600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the generated images were sometimes impressively realistic, it created a lot of bad output. As suggested by Alex Graves, his solution tends to generate what he calls "garbled letters", letters that no human would likely trace. In other cases, it would randomly skip some letters and be completely incapable of tracing some numbers or punctuation signs. Sometimes, the model would simply draw more or less flat lines. Since I wanted to generate fake &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt; data that I could trust and since the results were not reliable enough, I played with the bias and the priming lines before trying to train new models using Evgennii Dolotov's utility scripts. I failed to get better results than the pre-trained models, and failed to find the correct parameters to make sure I would obtain always realistic output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/PHST_fail_multiline.png" alt="several flat lines that at one point successfully write 'is fin'. This is a failed generated image." width="100px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- change image to add more examples --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I started exploring &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network"&gt;GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)&lt;/a&gt; which are models based on game theory. They are capable of generating realistic fake images learning from samples of real images (see &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3422622"&gt;Goodfellow et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). They are this kind of models used to generate photos of &lt;a href="https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en"&gt;people who don't exist&lt;/a&gt;. There are Github repositories offering source code to train such models to generate fake handwriting, such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/omni-us/research-GANwriting"&gt;GANwriting&lt;/a&gt; (described in &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02567"&gt;Kang et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;) or Amazon's &lt;a href="https://github.com/amzn/convolutional-handwriting-gan"&gt;ScrabbleGAN&lt;/a&gt; (introduced in &lt;a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Fogel_ScrabbleGAN_Semi-Supervised_Varying_Length_Handwritten_Text_Generation_CVPR_2020_paper.html"&gt;Fogel et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;) but they were only giving instructions to reproduce the corresponding papers and train the models ourselves. Since GANs are costly to train, I left this option out for the moment, even though I do think they can become an interesting solution in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I settled for a solution based on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model"&gt;Diffusion model&lt;/a&gt;. This type of model can be found behind applications like &lt;a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2"&gt;OpenAI's DALL-E&lt;/a&gt;. Luhman &amp;amp; Luhman (2020), who created the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tcl9876/Diffusion-Handwriting-Generation"&gt;Diffusion Handwriting Generation&lt;/a&gt; (later called DHG), explain very well how diffusion models work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Diffusion probabilistic models [...] convert a known distribution (e.g. Gaussian) into a more complex data distribution. A diffusion process converts the data distribution into a simple distribution by iteratively adding Gaussian noise to the data, and the generative model learns to reverse this diffusion process." (Luhman &amp;amp; Luhman, 2020, p. 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great advantage with DHG compared to the LSTM approach was that it was possible to easily fix the priming line and almost always obtain a convincing output. This was essential to create a dataset with a consistent handwriting over hundred of lines. As visible in the following image, even if the diffusion model is not capable of perfectly imitating the handwriting contained in the priming line, it usually successfully captures elements of style such as the slant, or the cursive nature of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/DHG_generated.png" alt="five pairs of priming lines with the resulting generated lines." width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several tests, I found that the third priming line gave the best results when associated with different text prompts, so I decided to use it along with excerpts from &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-0.txt"&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/a&gt; to create a completely artificially generated dataset. In a few days, I created more than 8,000 images (PNG) associated with a text file (TXT) containing the prompts used to generate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pairs could have been used "as is" to produce a silver synthetic dataset but, like I said before, I needed a gold dataset where the text and the images would be exact matches. Unfortunately, more than a third of the images did not qualify as gold. After manually reviewing about 2,500 of the lines (with the help of my colleague Hugo Scheithauer), we published a set of 1,280 pairs of lines and text under the name "&lt;a href="https://github.com/alix-tz/spinnerbait"&gt;Spinnerbait&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I was able to produce a dataset meeting my main criteria, I was actually disappointed with my results: I wanted a sort of magic button which would allow me to generate, at any time and without having to review it, a perfect set of training data. Instead, in the future, if I want to add more lines to Spinnerbait, I will have to spend a few hours going through each line to filter the bad ones out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I decided to take a few hours to manually copy a text taken from Guillaume Apollinaire's poems. I copied the text following a txt file that I would edit every time I would start a new line, I scanned it, segmented it with eScriptorium before copying and pasting the lines from the txt file and exported the result as a series of XML ALTO and images. It gave birth to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/alix-tz/moonshines"&gt;Moonshines&lt;/a&gt; dataset, a set of 1,186 lines (including 170 dedicated to a fixed test subset) of a single hand, thus comparable in size to Spinnerbaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think generating both datasets took about the same amount of time, if I take into account on the one hand reviewing the generated lines and on the other hand copying the text and passing it through eScriptorium. Moonshines used less computing resources and produced a richer dataset if we consider the aspect of the text. Also, the length of the lines is more varied in Moonshines whereas it is more homogenous (max 5 words) in Spinnerbait, because the generator tended to make more errors on longer prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/images/spinnerbait_moonshines.png" alt="a line taken from the Spinnerbait dataset and a line taken from the Moonshines dataset" widht="600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important limitation that I have barely addressed at this point it that not only do these tools fail to draw non-ASCII characters, but they also tend to have a greater chance of producing garbled letters when prompted with rare or non-english words&lt;sup id="fnref:iam"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fn:iam"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is true of all the systems I have tested. Of course, we could imagine training new models on data containing a greater diversity of languages, or simply other scripts or languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As way of a conclusion, I would say that even though I was disappointed with what I obtained down the line, this exploratory adventure was very interesting. I learned a lot and I am convinced that if I had more time and resources (and if it were more crucial for me), I would have found a way to get better results. I know of some coming publications that used GANs to create artificial data that look like lines taken from historical documents and I really look forward reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:icfhr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to find &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Tuw8uQonW7E?t=145"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a recording of the talk given on this tool at ICFHR 2020.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fnref:icfhr" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:online"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of handwritten text recognition, a distinction is made between "online" data and "offline" data. Offline data are based on a matrix of pixels containing the image of a text (they are static), whereas online data are vectors containing information about the speed, the points through which a line passes to form a letter, end of stroke points, etc. Online HTR uses data generated with an e-pen and a screen while offline HTR uses images created with a scanner or a camera.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fnref:online" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:customization"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the customizations consisted in removing non-ASCII characters or characters not supported by the model. It was easy to apply this transformation because in pytorch-handwriting-synthesis-toolkit, each model comes with a little metadata file which contains the character set handled by the model.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fnref:customization" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:iam"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the models were trained using the IAM database, more often the "online" database, but sometimes also with the "offline" version.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/011/#fnref:iam" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of this project was to explore new ways to index the content of thousands of thousands of notary registries which, put together, form &lt;a href="https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/siv/cms/content/fonds.action?uuid=12b&amp;amp;template=pog/pogLevel2&amp;amp;preview=false"&gt;one of the most used collections&lt;/a&gt; of the National Archives. I joined the project at the end of 2019, during its second phase, almost at the same time as &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium"&gt;eScriptorium&lt;/a&gt; was initiated. LECTAUREP had worked with &lt;a href="https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/?sc=Transkribus"&gt;Transkribus&lt;/a&gt; during the first phase (in 2018) but, given the connections between &lt;a href="http://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html"&gt;my research team&lt;/a&gt; and the team behind eScriptorium, we quickly switched to the newer software and contributed to its development.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my most important contribution is the redaction of &lt;a href="https://lectaurep.hypotheses.org/documentation/prendre-en-main-escriptorium"&gt;a tutorial for the software&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially only intended as an internal resource for our team of annotators. This is the reason why the tutorial was published on LECTAUREP's blog. &lt;a href="https://openiti.org/"&gt;OpenITI&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mar_Musa"&gt;Jonathan Allen&lt;/a&gt; rapidly offered &lt;a href="https://lectaurep.hypotheses.org/documentation/escriptorium-tutorial-en"&gt;an English translation&lt;/a&gt; which, eventually, was also published on LECTAUREP's blog. Since the publication of this translation, it is listed on eScriptorium's home page as its official tutorial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the tutorial hasn't been updated in a long time whereas major updates and new features have been added on eScriptorium's side.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LECTAUREP's blog is not a good solution. It is built with &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and hosted by &lt;a href="https://hypotheses.org/"&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; which is very convenient to allow a small, well defined, group of people to collaboratively work on a research blog, but it's too heavy and not adapted to publish the documentation of a software like eScriptorium. The documentation needs to be updated frequently to keep up with the software and, in general, a blog is not a place to publish the extensive documentation of a software. To top it all, it is not even that easy to update for me, so can you imagine someone outside of LECTAUREP trying to offer an update?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of finding a better solution since at least 2020, but it was never so urgent that I was able to put it at the top of my to-do lists. Last Summer, I took the advantage of a rather slow couple of weeks in August, when every one but me seemed to have gone on vacations, to put something different in place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://readthedocs.org/"&gt;Readthedocs&lt;/a&gt; quickly appeared to me as an ideal solution: the platform is designed for publishing software documentations, it handles software versions and multi-lingual contents. Last but not least, it uses static website generators. This is fundamental because it allows for the publication of the source code on a platforms like &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and will actually use this public source code to build the website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github is a platform designed for sharing and opening codes to external contributors. Relying on it solves a major issue with the current tutorial: if anyone can suggest the correction, edition or translation of eScriptorium's documentation, then it is more likely to keep up with the evolutions of the application!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, I created a new Github repository called &lt;a href="https://github.com/alix-tz/escriptorium-documentation"&gt;escriptorium-documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/#getting-started"&gt;set a basic configuration and connected it to Readthedocs&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as this was done, the website became available at &lt;a href="https://escriptorium.readthedocs.io/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; with a URL based on the following structure: &lt;code&gt;{gh_repo_name}.readthedocs.io&lt;/code&gt;. Then, I started rewriting the content of the tutorial... following &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html"&gt;Sphinx' syntax&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so painful that I never got back to it after I came back from my own vacations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why painful? Well, I had discovered Markdown in 2017 and I have used it since. It's so powerful and yet so light! In comparison, Sphinx felt like such a complicated and heavy syntax. Not as heavy as HTML, but less intuitive nonetheless. I had to go through the documentation every time I wanted to add something as simple as a hyperlink or an image!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, when I gathered enough motivation&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to go back to working on eScriptorium's tutorial, I decided to look for an alternative to &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/builders/index.html#sphinx.builders.html.DirectoryHTMLBuilder"&gt;Sphinx compilers&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only non-sphinx-based option available with readthedocs is &lt;a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html"&gt;Mkdocs&lt;/a&gt;. Like its name hints at, &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;Mkdocs&lt;/a&gt; is a Markdown compiler, capable to quickly build websites. The set-up is really quick, it's well documented, fairly easy to customize and it's possible to add a lot of &lt;a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown-extensions/#emoji"&gt;cool extensions which are based on Python&lt;/a&gt;. It was the bomb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked Mkdocs so much that I also used it to rebuild &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/"&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, I have spent a lot of time working on this new tutorial for eScriptorium. I designed a basic structure, breaking down the features into different categories. Now the pages are progressively being filled and I am very happy to have been joined in my efforts by my colleagues Hugo Scheithauer and Floriane Chiffoleau. As we progressively merge the content of new pages to the main branch, the &lt;a href="https://escriptorium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;escriptorium-tutorial&lt;/a&gt; website expands. It will be ready soon for an official release!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope that the transparency and simplicity brought by Mkdocs and Markdown will allow many people to add their contributions to the documentation of eScriptorium! Who knows, maybe you will too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: we changed the name of the repository to escriptorium-documentation instead of escriptorium-tutorial (all links and mentions were changed in this post). The decision was motivated by the fact the "tutorial" felt like an inexact description of the actual scope/ambition of the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also when I got more free time after &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/009/"&gt;my classes were over&lt;/a&gt;!¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to use readthedocs to deploy a website built with Mkdocs. In the case of the tutorial, it simply allows us to have a domain name more meaningful than ".github.io".¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/010/#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

There is always a chance that the weather won't be on my side, but I like the idea of starting the year peacefully and embracing nature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting 2023 though, and without much originality, I wanted to dedicate a last post for 2022 to looking back to my first full year of phD and focus on its biggest highlights as far as my phD project is concerned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the year sure didn't look like anything I had expected! I don't think I had envisioned any of what my trips to Montr√©al have brought me... but also how much they consume of the time available to actually work on my research project. As you will see, it is not necessarily a bad thing - I actually want to focus on the good parts - but it doesn't mean that it was easy to wrap my head around it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two thirds of the 2022 in Montr√©al: 8 months out of 12, with what looks right now like a super short 4 months of Summer in France in the middle. I specify that it was Summer because, you know, ... July and August, they're not usual months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 2022 passed in the blink of an eye.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time in class or preparing for class or working on final projects. Indeed, I took 4 classes out of the 5 required by the Universit√© de Montr√©al, and attended 1 as an auditor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCI6304 was a bibliometry class taught by Vincent Larivi√®re;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSL6523 was a Digital Museology class conducted by Emmanuel Chateau-Dutier;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LCO6525 was a Compared Chinese Literature class given by Victoria-Oana Lupascu;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HNU7000 was a class focused on the Epistemology of the Digital Humanities lead by Michael E. Sinatra;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and SCI6203, the extra class, was about AI and textual data, it was given by Dominic Forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, they were very diverse but I think I learned quite a few things from them that I will be able to use more or less directly for my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In HNU7000, we often had to write or present critical summaries of articles or conferences and in LCO6525, we were asked to turn in a "annotated bibliography" (at least 400 words for 6 references related to the topic of our final paper) halfway through the semester. With these exercises, I think I found a better way to summarize articles or books I read. I can still improve the "critical" aspect of the exercise, but I think I got better at summarizing what was actually relevant to me when I read. Now, I hope to publish some of these future summaries here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SCI6304, my final project consisted in a bibliometric investigation on the publications on HTR over the past 40 years. I would like to publish the result as an article, which is a project for 2023. But I can already see that doing so, I gained a much better understanding of the field(s) related to my research project, I found some keywords that I need to investigate and I added a bunch of references to my potentially-to-read list.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MSL6523, the final poject consisted in a blog post for &lt;a href="https://medium.com/museonum"&gt;Museonum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/museonum/intelligence-artificielle-et-intelligence-collective-des-nouveaux-eldorados-pour-rendre-les-c8c4e214d4e6"&gt;Mine&lt;/a&gt; was focused on the current use of automatic transcription and crowdsourcing by patrimonial institutions. I have already been able to reuse this post as a reading suggestion for a class where I was invited to present eScriptorium.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of other activities throughout the year (teaching, presenting at conferences, etc), but, as far as my thesis project is concerned, two of my biggest concerns were 1) reading and 2) refining my research project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried different strategies to read more, but I am a slow reader and my schedule is often fragmented. I have started finding the beginning of a solution in keeping one day of the week totally without meetings, and by always keeping it the same day. I started implementing this during the past semester and it seemed to work: Wednesday was the day I was going to the library or simply dedicating to my homework. On Wednesday, I never scheduled meetings (unless absolutely necessary). Now that I am back in France for 4 months, I need to make sure I am able to keep this routine. On the other hand, I am trying to solve the speed problem by better sorting the references I end up reading in order not to waste time on a text that was actually not a priority.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned in 2022 and that affects my reading is the usefulness of expanding the types of publications I read. Let me explain. Working at ALMAnaCH, I saw most of my colleagues focus on reading articles and pre-prints. The main objective there is to keep up to date with a state of the art that evolves quickly and for a discipline that is fairly recent. On the other hand, at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, more emphasis is placed on the conceptual frame of the research. Therefore, many more books and chapters, of disciplines that are not always the same as the envisioned project, make their way into the bibliographies. It might seem obvious to some of you, but it wasn't for me at the start of the year and this is exactly the type of enrichment I was looking for when I went for a &lt;em&gt;cotutelle&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as far as refining my research project is concerned, this is something that I didn't start solving before December. At the Universit√© de Montr√©al, when I apply for a grant, I often have to introduce my research project, including my methodology and the conceptual frame. Writing these texts, it often made me feel like I was not progressing in terms of making my project more precise. I had a general idea of the topic I wanted to work on and which issues I wanted to address in general, but no clear strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often thought about it during the year, looking for a way to solve this problem. It wasn't a question of narrowing down my topic or use-case, I think mine is/are already well defined. It is only at the occasion of a 20 minutes presentation assigned during the HNU7000 seminar that I sat at a table and put together my thoughts and the results of my discussions with my supervisors. I will soon dedicate a post to the current state of my research project, but what I think I was lacking the most was &lt;strong&gt;an angle&lt;/strong&gt; to efficiently narrow down the scope of my project and justify future choices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I started focusing on how different 2022 looked compared to what I had imagined, I am actually very happy with this year. I met a ton of people who have broadened my horizons on research and academia in general. And I start 2023 full of ideas for my phD and this blog! Keep an eye out for them in future posts!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>courses</category><guid>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/009/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 15:14:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>008 - A Canadian Grail</title><link>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/</link><dc:creator>Alix Chagu√©</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://starwalk.space/en/news/what-is-planet-parade"&gt;June 2022 witnessed a pretty cool planet alignment&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems this omen wasn't about my &lt;a href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/006/"&gt;registration to the RAMQ&lt;/a&gt; for my second semester in Canada. I didn't mean to post again about Health Insurance in Canada, but I can't resist telling this story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building from my experience (and mistakes) during Winter 2022, I thought that the process would be a piece of cake from then on. Uh-uh, not so fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At least, I started right from the beginning with the correct form!"&lt;sup id="fnref:right"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:right"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True. However, I got too confident in the speed of the process and forgot to take into account the French Summer vacations. I didn't send the signature request to my university before the 1st of August (a little over a month before my departure). The people in charge of signing were already on vacation. While this step had been very quick in Winter, this time it took almost a month: I only got the form with its signature back on the 30th of August, less than a week before my departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately printed the document and rushed to the Post office to send it to the &lt;a href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure"&gt;Assurance Maladie&lt;/a&gt;. I still had one month and two weeks to finish the full process in order to remove some 300$CA fees from the bill at the University of Montr√©al. It seemed feasible. In December, my initial envoy to the Assurance Maladie had seemingly never made it to the Assurance Maladie, so this time I decided to play it safe: I printed the document myself&lt;sup id="fnref:posting_online"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:posting_online"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and sent it as a registered letter, with a tracking number and a return receipt request.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How glad (and despairing) was I! Thanks to this tracking number, I was able to see that my letter... never left that Post office. After a week and a half, I sent a claim to La Poste, but since I couldn't wait for them to lead an investigation&lt;sup id="fnref:investigation_outcome"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:investigation_outcome"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my partner had to print the form a second time and send it again (I was already in Canada at that time).&lt;sup id="fnref:second_failure"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:second_failure"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! The letter finally made it to the Assurance Maladie. But the time frame was narrowing down quickly! I had to contact the Assurance Maladie via the mobile app to try to politely urge then to send it back to me quickly. Eventually, I received it duly signed on September 27. I had two weeks left to send it to the &lt;a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr"&gt;RAMQ&lt;/a&gt; and get an acceptation letter to be able to reduce my bill.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasting no time, I praised the RAMQ for allowing me to &lt;a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/citoyens/assurance-medicaments/inscrire-desinscrire/r2"&gt;upload the file(s) on their website&lt;/a&gt;, but cursed them when I received a confirmation notice telling me that they would take up to 60 days to process it. 60 days! I only had 17 left!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, as far as my bill was concerned, I had two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay the 300$CA and hope for the process to be over by the 15th of November (to have it refunded to me as a credit from UdeM on my next tuition&lt;sup id="fnref:credit"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fn:credit"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or refuse to pay that part of the bill and begin having a debt of 300$CA towards the University, potentially pay interests on it and hope for the process to be over by the 15th of November (to have it retroacctively removed from the bill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semester, I was only finally getting my 600$CA from Winter, because in February I had chosen the first and safest option. This time, I took a gamble and went for the second scenario. I wasn't sure of the actual consequences of contracting a debt with the University, but I was holding on the hope that the RAMQ wouldn't take as long as they announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October seemed to go by really slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sign of life from the RAMQ reached me on the 26th of October. Unfortunately, in a letter dated from the 14th, they listed all the items they expected to find in the form and rejected my request until I sent a complete form ASAP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait, what? My form, not complete?!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it possible I used the wrong form again? No, it wasn't that... Did I forget to check a box somewhere? No... Did the Assurance Maladie not correctly fill their part? No, still not that. What was wrong then? The only way to find out at that point was to call the RAMQ. I did so the following day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll skip the hour-long wait on the phone with (or without) music and, boom! Here is the answer: somehow, they only received the last page of the PDF I uploaded on their website. But twice. Twice the last page. The first page, nowhere to be seen!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refused to let a bug cost me 300$CA, so I begged the operator to let me have a way to send the missing page faster than the Post Office, and safer than their glitching upload platform. This is how I found myself (with my visiting partner) at the nearest Uniprix, playing with their public printer and sending my form... by fax!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiting resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how long it would take. Did that fax even reach the operator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready to give up on my 300$CA. I was losing hope that I would ever get an answer on time. I was cursing the University of Montr√©al for making it so stupidly complicated to remove an illegitimate amount from my bill, cursing the RAMQ and the Assurance Maladie for being so slow and not having automatized such a process with a shared plateform, cursing La Poste for being unreliable and losing my letters, cursing myself for not starting the process sooner, had I known! Raaaah!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on November 4, suddenly, unexpectedly, there it was. My Canadian Grail. The letter of acceptation into the RAMQ.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With trembling hands, unable to erase a smile from my face, blinking once or twice, I captured it with my phone, and connected to the Task Manager on the University of Montr√©al website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press "Confirm"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, a few days later poof! gone, my 300$CA debt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only remained, the 2,56$CA of interests generated during these three weeks, on a debt that should have never existed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I surrender, I won't fight any longer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll pay this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:right"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aka, I didn't use SE-401-Q-104, nor used the outdated version of SE-401-Q-106.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:right" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:posting_online"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Poste offers a service consisting in allowinf you to upoload a PDF which they will print and send for you. I used in December due to the difficulty to find a open Post office during the Christmas period.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:posting_online" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:investigation_outcome"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation took less than 2 weeks if I remember correctly. But I was right to make another envoy in parallel because they never found the letter and eventually sent me a refund.¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:investigation_outcome" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:second_failure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! It is the second time La Poste loses my SE-401-Q-106... How unlucky is that?¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:second_failure" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:credit"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explained in my the post n¬∞006, this amount is not directly refunded to you. It only appears as a debt to you from the University and will only be deducted from your next bill. It's unconvenient for two reasons: 1) it's a credit you end up giving the University and given the amount, you could really use that money for something else (like buying food for a month or paying rent), 2) when you don't pay tuition every semester (as is my case), you have to wait a really long time for that money to make it back to you!¬†&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/008/#fnref:credit" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In 2022, we were able to use this funding to hire several students from the &lt;a href="https://www.chartes.psl.eu/"&gt;√âcole nationale des chartes&lt;/a&gt; to produce entirely new transcriptions of documents from various periods (from Medieval times to 21st century), as well as to align already existing transcriptions with the corresponding images. We will hopefully have occasions to present this experiment further in the months to come, but today I would like to talk about the specific case of WikiCREMMA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other CREMMA datasets&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/007/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, WikiCREMMA also consisted of creating new images. Using exerpts from &lt;a href="https://github.com/PonteIneptique/wikicremma"&gt;randomly selected&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia articles (in French), we created forms which were then printed before we asked volunteers to copy the text by hand using the tools of their choice, thus collecting examples of nowadays handwritings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form is mostly composed with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explanations regarding the context of the experiment,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instructions on how to fill the form,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a short section where contributors can add their names, their writing hand (left or right) and their gender,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extract to copy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and a blank space where contributors ought to be writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each form offers a different short text to copy: it is thus possible for volunteers to contribute many forms. The exerpts were collected by sending requests to the "&lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A9cial:Page_au_hasard"&gt;Page au hasard&lt;/a&gt;" feature available in Wikipedia (in English, see "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random"&gt;random article&lt;/a&gt;").  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the forms were filled, we automatically &lt;a href="https://github.com/alix-tz/cremmawiki-anonymizer"&gt;anonymized them&lt;/a&gt; and then uploaded them on eScriptorium. This anonymization mostly meant adding a big black rectangle over the part of the page where contributors are invited to give us details about who they are. Once in eScriptorium, the images are segmented (aka lines of text are detected on the image) and then transcribed. We ignore all the printed text and only focus on the handwritten elements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we asked volunteers to copy a text, it is impossible to avoid crossed out words, blanks or mispellings. Therefore, even if we possess the original text, we did not automatize the transcription. This manual transcription takes time but it allows us to respect what was actually written by a volunteer. On the other hand, having access to the text they were asked to copy allows us to read them very quickly and to lift any doubt regarding what we should be reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created several batches of forms in order to test out the success (or failure) of our project. They don't always have the same size: Batch-01 contains 10 images whereas Batch-04 has 96 of them. Initially, we imagined leaving stacks of these forms in different spots, giving volunters the possibility to send us their form after they filled it. However, even if we dream big, it seemed safer to start with asking people around us. I've asked friends, colleagues, classmates, but also very random people to participate in this experiment -- maybe you, reader, also contributed! Overall, as far as I am concerned, this has been a lot of fun! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Fall 2022, more than 135 people took part in the experiment and we collected more than 300 pages. Not everything was transcribed yet, but we were already able to publish 242 images along with their transcription in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/HTR-United/cremma-wikipedia"&gt;CREMMA-WIKIPEDIA&lt;/a&gt; repository. It adds up to a total of 1331 lines and 64691 characters for contemporary handwritings in French. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the images and the transcription, I proposed to add a series of metadata. They would allow potential users of the dataset to sort the files according to several criterias. They include the writing hand, the color of the ink or else the type of tool used to write (pencil/marker/ink pen/etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were already able to use part of this dataset since it was included in the TrainSet of &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6657809#.Y1BEtEyZOuU"&gt;Manu McFrench&lt;/a&gt;, an HTR model for modern and contemporary French!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lots of ideas for future usages and developments for this dataset so it will be back in other posts of this blog!&lt;/p&gt;

At the University of Montreal, it costs 300$CA per semester (more details &lt;a href="http://www.bei.umontreal.ca/bei/ass_couverture.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There is also an additional plan specific to dental insurance. By default, students are signed up for these two plans, hence the fees included in the univeristy bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is possible to waive such fees if a student already has another insurance. A little warning here: saving on health insurance plans is cool on paper, but you should make sure you actually do have a working alternative before you cancel the one offered by the university. Medical fees in Canada can add up very quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French citizens covered by the French Health Insurance (&lt;a href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure"&gt;Assurance Maladie&lt;/a&gt;) can benefit from an agreement between Qu√©bec and France in order to sign up, for free, for the &lt;a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr"&gt;RAMQ&lt;/a&gt;, the Qu√©bec Health Insurance (&lt;em&gt;R√©gie de l'Assurance Maladie du Qu√©bec&lt;/em&gt;). This is not an automatic process: it is not because you are French that you can immediately revoke the Health Insurance fees from the university. You must first sign up for the RAMQ, then, providing a proof of affiliation to the RAMQ, you can ask for the fees to be removed. There are deadlines to do so and the process is slow because both the RAMQ and the Assurance Maladie are public services. During your very first semester in Canada, it can be hard to finish the process in time to avoid having to pay for the University's default health plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main steps are the following: you must get a form signed by the Health Insurance in France, then send it to the RAMQ along with a few other papers, and then, once you receive (by post mail!) the confirmation that the RAMQ accepted your application, you must submit such proof to the University in order to waive the health insurance fees. It takes a few days to receive the confirmation that your health plan is valid and for the fees to be removed from the bill.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health insurance wise, several deadlines were applicable. For Winter 2022, mine were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by the 14th of February, I had to have fully paid my tuition;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which meant I had until the 13th of February to remove any fee I did not want to pay;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if not, I had to pay the full bill. Then I had until the 15th of March to finish the paperwork and request a refund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, I may have mentioned it already, but there is a series of fees that are automatically added to a student's bill even if they are not mandatory. At the University of Montreal, they are called the "CANO" (&lt;em&gt;cotisations automatiques non obligatoires&lt;/em&gt;). There is (&lt;a href="https://ombudsman.umontreal.ca/foire-aux-questions/faq/news/detail/News/comment-me-desister-des-assurances-ou-dautres-frais-non-obligatoires/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) a rather complete documentation on which fees belong to this category, how much money they represent, what they pay for and the various processes to waive them. There are generally not related to health insurance, but the documentation also explains how to sign off from the dental and regular health insurance. Following these explanations, I got most of the CANO fees taken off my bill, as well as the fees related to the dental insurance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point I was left with 600$CA to get rid off, corresponding to the main health insurance (in Winter, you pay the health insurance plan for both Winter and Summer).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was difficult to get information about the agreement between France and Qu√©bec on the Assurance Maladie's website. They don't dedicate a lot of text to this situation on the corresponding page (&lt;a href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/droits-demarches/europe-international/protection-sociale-etranger/etudes-etranger"&gt;"insurance and studies abroad"&lt;/a&gt;) and it mixes studies inside Europe and outside of Europe, which are very different.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For studies in Qu√©bec, it is said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;students traveling to Qu√©bec within the frame of a university exchange should use the form &lt;a href="https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/media/2516"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SE Q-401-106&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and that students enrolled in the Qu√©bec university should instead use the form &lt;strong&gt;SE Q-401-102&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say nothing about which situation applies to a PhD student in &lt;em&gt;cotutelle&lt;/em&gt;: is it considered a university exchange since you are enrolled in a French university or is it considered to be like enrolling in a Qu√©bec university? For most of my paperwork with Canada, aside from the &lt;em&gt;convention de cotutelle&lt;/em&gt;, my paperwork was essentially the same as someone enrolling only to a Canadian university. Additionally, SE 401-Q-106 required the French university to sign the form, whereas SE 401-Q-102 only required a signature from the Assurance Maladie. SE 401-Q-102 seemed applicable and faster, so I opted for it. Let's say it right away: it was a mistake. I should have opted for SE 401-Q-106 from the beginning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In whichever situation you are in, you cannot simultaneously be enrolled in the French Assurance Maladie and the RAMQ. So both of the form will suspend your enrolling to the Assurance Maladie in order to get you into the RAMQ system. The main difference between the two forms is actually that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SE 401-Q-102 will have you struck off from the Assurance Maladie (and likely asked to destroy your Carte Vitale), until you come back to France and go through the process (and paperwork) to be reintegrated into the system,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whereas SE 401-Q-106 will have your rights temporarily deactivated: with SE 401-Q-106 you must provide the precise dates of your travel to Qu√©bec. Upon your return, your rights are simply (and normally automatically) reactivated.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it short, both forms work for a &lt;em&gt;cotutelle&lt;/em&gt;. But if you are going to Canada for only one semester, you should go for the SE 401-Q-106!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized my mistake after arriving to Qu√©bec and talking with other French people having recently moved to Montreal. At the end of January, when it was clear I had made a mistake, I was still waiting for the Assurance Maladie to return the signed SE 401-Q-102 form. I decided to start over and sent the SE 401-Q-106 form to my university. They signed returned it within one day. I sent it to the Assurance Maladie explaining my mistake and asked to start over. Because of this error, I wasn't able to waive the 600$CA from my bill before the February deadline: I had to pay the tuition along with the 600$CA. Then I focused on finishing the paperwork on time to be able to ask for a refund. Luckily, it played out pretty well and I now have a 600$CA credit line with the University of Montreal, waiting to be deduced from my next tuition in September.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the unfortunate news for me is that due to the fact that I will be traveling to Canada every other trimester, I'll have to do this process each time, since it is only applicable one trip at a time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before closing this rather long post, I want to mention another mistake I made. Form SE 401-Q-102 and SE 401-Q-106 are impossible to find on the Assurance Maladie's website. I found both forms via a Google search, but it is said that you can request the form to the Assurance Maladie's services. Unfortunately, the SE 401-Q-106 that I found was an old version: I only found out when I submitted it to the RAMQ. They refused it, even though the Assurance Maladie had signed it, and I had to go through the whole signature process one more time. Speak of unnecessary paperwork... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend using the forms provided on the RAMQ website: they are common to both the French and the Qu√©bec administration and actually findable on the RAMQ's website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final warning: upon talking with some of my fellow French students at the University of Montreal, I realized that not every university will be quick when it comes to signing the SE 401-Q-106 form. Other universities may ask student to first finish the writing and signature of the &lt;em&gt;convention de cotutelle&lt;/em&gt;. This is particularly unfair because completing this process can take a whole year and you may start traveling during this period, as is my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now you have your visa and a health insurance? Let's go look for a bank and a roof!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>health insurance</category><category>tuition</category><guid>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/006/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 15:52:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>005 - Visa and Immigration</title><link>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/005/</link><dc:creator>Alix Chagu√©</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I introduced the functioning of an international &lt;em&gt;cotutelle&lt;/em&gt; and focused on the administrative details from the universities' point of view. Now, I would like to take the time to list and explain other administrative requirements, which are not always foreseen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with immigration: unless you are a citizen of both the countries involved in the &lt;em&gt;cotutelle&lt;/em&gt;, you will need at least one visa. Maybe two if you are a citizen of neither.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only needed a visa for Canada since I am already a French citizen. So, as soon as I got my letter of acceptance from the University of Montreal, I started the paperwork in order to obtain a Student Visa (&lt;em&gt;Permis d'√âtudes&lt;/em&gt;) covering the full duration of my studies. There is a lot of documentation available on the main steps, both from the University of Montreal (http://www.bei.umontreal.ca/bei/form_info.htm) and from the &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/fr/immigration-refugies-citoyennete/services/etudier-canada/permis-etudes/presenter-demande.html"&gt;canadian immigration services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of documents I had to provide the Canadian administration with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my passport (which I had recently renewed so it will remain valid until way after the end of my PhD adventures);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;id photos in US format;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proof that I could fund my stay in Canada and pay my tickets back to France (which means proving you have enough savings, that someone with enough savings/income will be supporting you, or that you will have a guaranteed income during your stay);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the letter of acceptance from the University of Montreal;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the "&lt;em&gt;Certificat d'Acceptation du Qu√©bec&lt;/em&gt;" (CAQ), which is essentially like asking for a visa to Qu√©bec (Province level) before asking for a visa to Canada (Federal level).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it was my first time requesting a visa to Canada, I also had to get my biometrics collected. It cost me 85$CA and I had to make an appointment at a dedicated center in Clichy (next to Paris) where my fingerprints where taken along with some photos. Very few people went through this process at the time, because a new wave of COVID was coming up. I believe the whole appointment in Clichy, between the moment I entered the building and the moment I left, lasted less than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, the CAQ is like asking for another visa but from Qu√©bec. It's a bit like a hidden sub-quest inside the main quest: you can't move on before you've completed it. Luckily, getting the CAQ was not too complicated. Mostly, it cost me additional fees (117$CA) and meant I had to do extra paperwork. This time, I had to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contact information;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;again, a proof that I could pay for my stay in Qu√©bec and pay my tickets back to France;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a copy of my passport;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;id photos in US format;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and a form which I had to fill &lt;a href="http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/services/caq-electronique/index.html"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAQ process was really quick: on the 13th of September, I turned in a pre-request and paid the 117$CA fees to obtain an application number, then the next day I was given access to a platform where I could upload my documents. I did so on the 17th, got a read confirmation on the 23rd and a digital copy of the CAQ on the 24th. I later received the original CAQ by post mail, but the digital copy was enough to start the visa application. So, all in all, it took less than 2 weeks. As a French citizen, I was able to avoid additional steps like undergoing a medical examination or having to request an ETA (Electronical Traveling Authorization).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited until I had obtained the CAQ to start the visa application.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the visa, I created an account on the dedicated platform on the 30th of September. It allowed me to start a session to request the visa, upload my files, access new forms I had to fill and pay the fees which were 150$CA (+ the 85$CA for the biometrics). Only once I had done this was I able to make the appointment for the biometrics: I had to wait for an email giving me instructions, which I received on the next day. My appointment was scheduled for the 6th of October, then the next day I received a confirmation that my visa request had been approved. At that point, I expected to have to go to the Canadian Embassy to receive the physical visa, like I had to for a US visa a few years ago, but I was informed instead that such an appointment would take place upon crossing the Canadian border. I had until the 15th of January 2026 to do so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did cross the border in January 2022, after landing at the Montreal international airport. Before I could exit the airport, I had to go to a specific area of the building dedicated to the immigration services. I got a waiting number and waited to be called to the front desk for over 1h. Then I had to show various papers, including, above all, my passport, the letter of acceptance from the University of Montreal, the official CAQ letter, the notification of acceptance for the study visa as well as any proof of funding for my stay and information regarding my travel back to France. Essentially, they verified that everything I had submitted was true and asked me to provide the address where I would stay in Canada. I believe I stayed a bit under 2h at the immigration services in the airport and eventually was issued my official &lt;em&gt;Permis d'√âtudes&lt;/em&gt;. It's not a stamp or a sticker added to my passport, it's a paper document in US Letter format.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, obtaining the visa cost me 352$CA but the process took less than a month and I was able to take advantage of the COVID situation: delays were shorter because less people were traveling, and many process had been fully digitized which meant I didn't have to send papers by post mail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial plan was to gather immigration, health insurance, housing and banking all in one post. Clearly there is a lot to say on these topics, so instead, they'll each have their own post. Next: health insurance!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>visa</category><guid>https://alix-tz.github.io/phd/posts/005/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 13:52:37 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
